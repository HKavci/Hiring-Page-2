I built two responsive pages for mobile/desktop as designed in the Figma design. Codes created with mobile-first approach.

## What I used
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript


## Notes
- The waiting list table mockdata created in db.json file and the data is fetched from this file. So we can test fetching process. 
- If the "?" icon is clicked, the modal opens and closes.
- When the "rotate" icon is clicked, the page restarts.
- When the "arrow" icon is clicked, the waiting list table expands and collapses.
